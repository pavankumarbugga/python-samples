# Given a  2D Array, :

# 1 1 1 0 0 0

# An hourglass in  is a subset of values with indices falling in this pattern in 's graphical representation:

# a b c
#   d
# e f g
# There are  hourglasses in . An hourglass sum is the sum of an hourglass' values. Calculate the hourglass sum for every hourglass in , then print the maximum hourglass sum. The array will always be .

# Example


# -9 -9 -9  1 1 1 
#  0 -9  0  4 3 2
# -9 -9 -9  1 2 3
#  0  0  8  6 6 0
#  0  0  0 -2 0 0
#  0  0  1  2 4 0
# The  hourglass sums are:

# -63, -34, -9, 12, 
# -10,   0, 28, 23, 
# -27, -11, -2, 10, 
#   9,  17, 25, 18
# The highest hourglass sum is  from the hourglass beginning at row , column :

# 0 4 3
#   1
# 8 6 6

# Constraints
# . -9 <= arr[i][j] <= 9
# . 0 <= i,j <= 5
# Output Format

# Print the largest (maximum) hourglass sum found in .

# Sample Input

# 1 1 1 0 0 0
# 0 0 2 4 4 0
# 0 0 0 2 0 0
# 0 0 1 2 4 0
# Sample Output

# 19
